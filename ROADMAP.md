# ROADMAP

## Editing

Deferred items are for items that need significant systems we cannot do now.
If you can do the item now, do NOT add to the deferred list.

Do NOT add new deferred work as a roadmap item. Place it in
`docs/DEFERRED.md`. If a TODO item is not FULLY completed, split the
TODO item, keeping the concise short dash point list with block infront and
split it as another item under the same version.

For example, if we complete A and B but not C and D:
```
### v0.5
- [x] do: A1, A3, A5
- [_] do: A, B, C, D
- [x] do: G, H, I
- [x] do: K, K2, K3
```

becomes:
```
### v0.5
- [x] do: A1, A3, A5
- [x] do: A, B
- [x] do: G, H, I
- [x] do: K, K2, K3
- [_] do: C, D
- [_] deferred `D0001` for later.
```

or defer to another version.

## VERSIONS

The milestone headings below are development labels. Not in line with project versioning.

### v0.24

- [_] find a way to (easily) and thoroughly test rendering steps and ensure they produce the right image with right projections
- [_] finish portals so lighting, physics, projection, clipping and geometry crossing the seam are seamless, build an actual demo that agent can see that properly visualises this
- [_] ensure per-mesh render capabilities, global lighting render capabilities, camera lighting render capabilities, etc. compute shaders, post-processing, etc. - per-mesh capability flags are per-instance visual state and belong in the GPU-resident row, so a compute pass can branch on them without a CPU readback
- [_] simplify and strip old rendering code that is not part of the node system. Everything should be in the node system. - the residency and delta upload are a node too, so the sweep and the GPU-resident work are the same refactor rather than two passes over the same files
- [_] port semi-real raytrace and path-trace as part of nodes
- [_] make demo render pipelines with semi-real raytrace and path-trace
- [_] add compute shaders / postprocessing shaders to all visual items as a additional node to attach (render pipeline pulls and residents shaders on gpu when active)
- [_] (dynamic) ambient occulusion, emissivity, mipmapping, occulusion culling (bbox first, extra after), sRGB handle, proper PBR with tests, tesselation, add Fog/Clouds/Skybox compute shader support, screen-space, global illumination, displacement maps (make it rendering only but not physical) - "rendering only but not physical" is exactly the transform/visual split the GPU-resident set draws, so all of this is GPU-side state with no CPU mirror to keep in step
- [_] more blender-like render pipeline ideas and build-out
- [_] render pipeline nodes for above
- [_] plan the entire rendering system to a visual compositor system like Unity. https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/scriptable-render-pipeline-introduction.html https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.visual-compositor@0.27/manual/nodes.html
- [_] ensure full parallel/vectorised (i.e. get all active scenes => build entity list => update gpu resident => batch render all cameras in every scene) - stable entity slots, per-world particle pools and batched camera submission are built. The remaining work is the product-side active-scene collector and parallel presentation walk; every camera can already read its world's buffers without re-uploading them.
- [_] better memory packing for editablemeshes and editabletextures. also add quantization support for editablemesh and editabletexture as a component that rounds values and such (e.g. (u)float16, (u)float8, (u)int16, (u)int8, (u)int4, bool) test many 4k textures on gpu and packing. test an atlas system on gpu too.
- [_] different antialiasing choices as render nodes
- [_] level-of-details (4 different meshes version, auto-decimate version, smart-triangle-reduction-version thinking of nanite triangle surface area, nanite style) - LOD selection is a per-instance visual decision and belongs in the GPU-resident set beside the occlusion cull that already runs there, so a level change costs no CPU round trip.

### v0.25

- [_] /docs/future-work/character-system.md
- [_] gtlf default character (unreal style)

### v0.26

- [_] project demos: space engineers asteroids + planets full demo, huge medieval battle full ai war, ai magic battle with tons of particles and explosions and whatnot, ai village with daily routines and such
- [_] create another demo of a ai npc village where they have daily tasks and things like that (dwarf fortress style - personality, occupation, etc).
- [_] pathfinding
- [_] more advanced pathfinding where you can specify wall climbing and stuff, like a "can climb" zone or stuff lik that for ai too

- [_] /docs/future-work/world-streaming.md
- [_] /docs/future-work/terrain-system.md
- [_] /docs/future-work/navigation-ai-system.md
- [_] /docs/future-work/physics-expansion.md

### FUTURE

- [_] go through docs/future-work/REVISIT_IDEAS.md for things we can do sooner.
- [_] maybe consider converting a bunch of custom tools to plugins and have them built-in to studio, or make a plugin pack as a extra release file you can import to a plugins/ folder in ~/Documents/atomic-game-engine/studio/plugins
- [_] (procedural, node-based) terrain generator (refer to discord references) - editablemesh, greedymesh, noise layers, node graph with previews, chunk-based, etc. Add voxel mode (which separates cardinal facing direction Fnt/Bk/Lft/Rgt/Top/Bott faces into groups - only renders the two groups it can see). Expand with surfacecameras, portals, etc, so it culls, occulusion culls, etc.
- [_] unity porting tools / unity shop
- [_] consider adding C# as another scripting langauge?
- [_] constraints system
- [_] deferred `D00106` - JavaScript and TypeScript breakpoints. The vendored QuickJS exposes no line hook and no debugger API at all, so this is a submodule decision rather than a feature. Asking for one on a .js/.ts chunk is refused with the reason, at the service, the gutter and the panel alike. **The TypeScript half of the entry shipped at v0.15 and is not part of this** - source maps are emitted and read, so the lines a debugger would land on are already the right ones.
- [_] full audio DAW (digital audio workbench) system
- [_] built-in whiteboxing tools (planning) for building (plugin)
- [_] full procedural terrain studio tools
- [_] full ui feature buildout + custom
- [_] ui creation tool, full aspect ratio scaling, select how it scales, how panels scale, etc. easier version of tooling than manually building them out
- [_] html-based ui creation (html-script?) => auto handles aspect constraints and whatnot as well, css as well. "virtual container" that makes/simulates the instances?
- [_] figma import tools
- [_] import blender files in asset explorer natively (drag .blend files on engine)
- [_] rpg maker port tool
- [_] photoshop file reader and import tool
- [_] docs/MOBILE.md implementation
- [_] concept idea: setup a public mcp repository in python, add .mcp.json in project folder that loads it, it watches forums channels in the discord server for new/existing bugs. agent writes a message in the channel stating you're fixing it, other agents work on other bugs. agents can write that "this bug is a big rewrite" in the channel too which could be helpful. as a custom plugin? maybe just consider as a separate project.
- [_] localization support
- [_] could we try some minecraft shaders / pbr texture packs as test items? maybe upload to my cdn and then load it and ill check if it works
- [_] add modulescript boundaries between luau and javascript VMs. moving values between vms. add a container component flag to enable it. add a [experiment] marker.
- [_] add model providers (e.g. npcs in a game and can chat with you)
- [_] VR support (oculus rift s)
- [_] setup a studio permissions system for: microphone, camera, etc
- [_] setup a example plugin for mocap with camera point track
- [_] breakpoint history list per-script (show each iteration of breakpoint, can see change overtime)
- [_] expand breakpoint system to also include profilers like the heap allocation and timed flamegraph, you can see bottlenecks per iteration then (e.g. we can setup a "total compute", "total memory alloc", "total memory release", etc)
- [_] expose automation tools like mouse clicks and keyboard inputs to luau scripts (so we can create ai that plays for you)
- [_] expose a AutomationService that does this for you (need to enable it for it to be useable).
- [_] ECS driven RL agent environments
- [_] use a spatial walk (octree) to find hallways and such and use that baked information for things like the LOD, unrendering objects, etc. full node based logic for customisation.

### Open Decision

1. Move "roblox files to atomic game files" to a external program? The port tool.
