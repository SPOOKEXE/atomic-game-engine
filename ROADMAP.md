# ROADMAP

## Editing

Deferred items are for items that need significant systems we cannot do now.
If you can do the item now, do NOT add to the deferred list.

Do NOT add new deferred work as a roadmap item. Place it in
`docs/DEFERRED.md`. If a TODO item is not FULLY completed, split the
TODO item, keeping the concise short dash point list with block infront and
split it as another item under the same version.

For example, if we complete A and B but not C and D:
```
### v0.5
- [x] do: A1, A3, A5
- [_] do: A, B, C, D
- [x] do: G, H, I
- [x] do: K, K2, K3
```

becomes:
```
### v0.5
- [x] do: A1, A3, A5
- [x] do: A, B
- [x] do: G, H, I
- [x] do: K, K2, K3
- [_] do: C, D
- [_] deferred `D0001` for later.
```

or defer to another version.

## VERSIONS

The milestone headings below are development labels. Not in line with project versioning.

### v0.19



### v0.20

- [_] thoroughly implement every user-interface element, including `SurfaceGui` and `BillboardGui` - `SurfaceGui` gains `ZOffset`, `MaxDistance`, `ClipsDescendants` and `Active`, and `BillboardGui` gains `Active`, `Brightness`, `ClipsDescendants`, `CurrentDistance`, `DistanceStep`, `ExtentsOffsetWorldSpace`, `SizeOffset` and `PlayerToHideFrom`; new classes `UIGradient`, `UITableLayout`, `UIPageLayout` and `UIDragDetector`; `ScrollingFrame` completed with `ScrollingEnabled`, `AutomaticCanvasSize`, the two `ScrollBarInset`s, `VerticalScrollBarPosition`, `ElasticBehavior`, the three bar images and `AbsoluteCanvasSize`/`AbsoluteWindowSize`, plus wheel and thumb-drag input; `RichText`, `MaxVisibleGraphemes`, `ContentText`, `TextBounds` and `TextFits` on every text class; `Interactable`, the four `NextSelection*`, `SelectionOrder` and `SelectionImageObject` on `GuiObject`; `HoverImage`, `PressedImage` and `ResampleMode` on the image classes; `Enabled` and `ApplyStrokeMode` on `UIStroke`. Laid out, drawn by both backends, saved, replicated, bound and in the Properties panel. `D00129` carries the members that need a subsystem this engine has not got (filed as `D00120`, renumbered at v0.17 - that number was already a retired entry)
- [_] build out all remaining roblox surfaces with available underlying surface - all seven texture channels now resolve, stream, preview and render; metalness reaches forward and deferred PBR, alpha follows Overlay, Transparency, TintMask and Opaque semantics including masked shadows, and surface colour, emission and resampling are saved, replicated, bound and packed into the 48-byte GPU-resident instance row. Content-object aliases remain outside this item because the engine has no `Content` object type beneath them
- [_] port many particle features from unity to here (https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.5/Documentation/ScriptReference/ParticleSystem.html) - the existing lifetime curves, shape emission, drag, velocity inheritance, texture sheets and orientation modes are joined by distance emission, a live `MaxParticles` capacity, one-shot `Emit` from disabled emitters and `Clear`, a speed ceiling, scrolling procedural noise, and radial and tangential acceleration. Shared emitter values occupy the six reserved words in the GPU parameter row, while the 28-byte quantised `ParticleInstance` remains unchanged. The host fallback and `particle-step.comp` implement the same forces, the authored controls save and bind in both languages, and limit edits reclaim the resident block at its new size. Collision, sub-emitters and external force fields are not inert properties here: each needs an underlying collision/event/field subsystem before it can honestly be exposed
- [_] `~/Documents/GitHub/BLADEBORNE_UNIFIED/game` port and also studio place `~/Documents/Bladeborne Floor 0.rbxl`. Turn this into a demo file.
- [_] go through and do a full batched-compute of all world systems for things like replication, sending to gpu, iterating components, etc. Assume multi-processing for each individual world (hytale-style) and multi-threading for viable options. Vectorise rest (we test with -O0/-O1, but assume release -O2/3 will greatly improve it).

### v0.21

- [_] find a way to (easily) and thoroughly test rendering steps and ensure they produce the right image with right projections
- [_] finish portals so lighting, physics, projection, clipping and geometry crossing the seam are seamless
- [_] ensure per-mesh render capabilities, global lighting render capabilities, camera lighting render capabilities, etc. compute shaders, post-processing, etc. - per-mesh capability flags are per-instance visual state and belong in the GPU-resident row, so a compute pass can branch on them without a CPU readback
- [_] simplify and strip old rendering code that is not part of the node system. Everything should be in the node system. - the residency and delta upload are a node too, so the sweep and the GPU-resident work are the same refactor rather than two passes over the same files
- [_] port semi-real raytrace and path-trace as part of nodes
- [_] make demo render pipelines with semi-real raytrace and path-trace
- [_] (dynamic) ambient occulusion, screen-space, fog, atmosphere, clouds, global illumination, displacement maps (make it rendering only but not physical) - "rendering only but not physical" is exactly the transform/visual split the GPU-resident set draws, so all of this is GPU-side state with no CPU mirror to keep in step
- [_] render pipeline nodes for above
- [_] plan the entire rendering system to a visual compositor system like Unity. https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/scriptable-render-pipeline-introduction.html https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.visual-compositor@0.27/manual/nodes.html
- [_] viewport indictator direction gizmo (select and lock to certain directions)
- [_] 3d cursor and camera orbit options under gizmo
- [_] ensure full parallel/vectorised (i.e. get all active scenes => build entity list => update gpu resident => batch render all cameras in every scene) - stable entity slots, per-world particle pools and batched camera submission are built. The remaining work is the product-side active-scene collector and parallel presentation walk; every camera can already read its world's buffers without re-uploading them.
- [_] create a universe/world export menu with options to include assets in the export (only processed, also raw), as a folder of a assets/ with name.aworld (or we can do a name.auniverse that loads a bunch of name.aworld and warns on missing ones listed in auniverse)?

### v0.22

- [_] build out default plugins (move all topbar tools and stuff to plugins as a "Default Studio" plugin)
- [_] build out plugin function suite (create dropdown, edit toolbar, edit viewport, edit script editors, etc)
- [_] universe shared assets folder and setup easy cdn with it (when you load the universe file, it sets up a cdn with it).
- [_] add a universe loading widget - shows cdns the universe has and asks to allow permission, also http enabled property if changed
- [_] add tabs to the universe importer: general, assets, permissions, cdn, misc with all or per-world breakdown

### v0.23

- [_] default R6 base character (capsule collider)
- [_] gtlf default character (unreal)
- [_] make humanoid a shim for character controller (so not a black box), loads a default one in
- [_] character controller + humanoid + character states + state controller + bone controller, etc. More modular than roblox standard humanoid. state machine? node graphs? etc.
- [_] animation handler
- [_] skinning and animation - `bake` skips joints and weights and keeps the rest pose, because there are no skeletons in the engine yet - joint palettes are visual transform state and go GPU-resident beside the instance rows; the animation *controller* that produces them stays on the CPU, per the split above
- [_] add accessories support

### FUTURE

- [_] unity porting tools / unity shop
- [_] roblox porting tools (rbxl) - in the widget that pops up, show all asset ids and make a assets selector so you can click which asset id points to which file asset (same for animations and whatnot where possible).
- [_] (procedural, node-based) terrain generator (refer to discord references) - generated chunks feed the GPU-resident set as ordinary visual state; the collision mesh they also produce stays CPU-side, per the split above
- [_] porting roblox games (DEFER THIS UNTIL LATER ONCE TYPES ARE BUILT UP) - untouched, and the trigger is unchanged: there are four instance classes in this engine and a Roblox place names hundreds. Will show a widget that tells you conflicts and missing classes.
- [_] add modulescript boundaries between luau and javascript VMs. moving values between vms.
- [_] consider adding C# as another scripting langauge?
- [_] constraints system
- [_] deferred `D00106` - JavaScript and TypeScript breakpoints. The vendored QuickJS exposes no line hook and no debugger API at all, so this is a submodule decision rather than a feature. Asking for one on a .js/.ts chunk is refused with the reason, at the service, the gutter and the panel alike. **The TypeScript half of the entry shipped at v0.15 and is not part of this** - source maps are emitted and read, so the lines a debugger would land on are already the right ones.
- [_] full audio DAW (digital audio workbench) system
- [_] embedded whiteboxing tools (planning)
- [_] full procedural terrain studio tools
- [_] full ui features
- [_] level-of-details (4 different meshes version, auto-decimate version, smart-triangle-reduction-version thinking of nanite triangle surface area) - LOD selection is a per-instance visual decision and belongs in the GPU-resident set beside the occlusion cull that already runs there, so a level change costs no CPU round trip
- [_] project demos: space engineers asteroids + planets full demo, blackhole simulator (warp space, warp visual, etc), huge medieval battle full ai war, ai magic battle with tons of particles and explosions and whatnot, user interface (copy bladeborne's for demo?)
- [_] datastores (sqlite, mongo, supabase, etc - make a selection with local and remote setups)
- [_] html-based ui creation (html-script?)
- [_] import blender files in asset explorer
- [_] concept idea: setup a public mcp repository in python, add .mcp.json in project folder that loads it, it watches forums channels in the discord server for new/existing bugs. agent writes a message in the channel stating you're fixing it, other agents work on other bugs. agents can write that "this bug is a big rewrite" in the channel too which could be helpful.
- [_] smart platform backend where only "admitted keys" can connect to a given server - i.e. whitelist-based servers (press play on website => generate play key => platform tells server user is connecting with key => send key + server to user => user connects to server using key and info => join)
- [_] rpg maker port tool
- [_] docs/MOBILE.md implementation
- [_] add a components view (inspector in unity) where you can see components.
- [_] add a way to "expose" component values as configs for "components view" - this way you can tweak values without opening it.
