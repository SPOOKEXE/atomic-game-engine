# ROADMAP

## Editing

Do NOT add new deferred work as a roadmap item. Place it in
`docs/DEFERRED.md`. The existing `Deferred:` blocks below are version history
and pointers to that register. If a TODO item is not FULLY completed, split the
TODO item, keeping the concise short dash point list with block infront and
split it as another item under the same version.

For example, if we complete A and B but not C and D:
```
### v0.5
- [x] do: A1, A3, A5
- [_] do: A, B, C, D
- [x] do: G, H, I
- [x] do: K, K2, K3
```

becomes:
```
### v0.5
- [x] do: A1, A3, A5
- [x] do: A, B
- [x] do: G, H, I
- [x] do: K, K2, K3
- [_] do: C, D
- [_] deferred `D0001` for later.
```

or defer to another version.

## VERSIONS

The milestone headings below are development labels. Not in line with project versioning.

### v0.14

- use tools and see what needs fixing
- use tools and see what to improve
- blocky character spawning
- animation handler
- character controller + humanoid + character states + state controller, etc. More modular than roblox standard humanoid. state machine? node graphs? etc.

### v0.?? (needs prototype project first)

- [_] extended rendering pipeline (handle multiple worlds in parallel, handling gpu traffic)
- [_] rendering pipeline is a node system with a studio editor
- [_] surfaceapperance actually integrated with new pipeline
- [_] render pipeline is per world, not per process
- [_] render pipelines are saved in the world's export data
- [_] rendering pipeline debugger and profiler - shows a graph's per-step operations with their compute costs and wall clock, etc.
- [_] rendering pipeline additions; ambient occulusion, emissive, pbr, default node setup with all these
